Harvold\\u2019s hideous experiments in the 1970s and 80s would not go over well with PETA or with anyone who has ever really cared for animals. Working from a lab in San Francisco, he gathered a troop of rhesus monkeys and stuffed silicone deep into the nasal cavities of half of them, leaving the other half as they were. The obstructed animals couldn\\u2019t remove the plugs, and they couldn\\u2019t breathe at all through their noses. They were forced to adapt to constant mouthbreathing. Over the next six months, Harvold measured the animals\\u2019 dental arches, the angles of their chins, the length of their faces, and more. The plugged-up monkeys developed the same downward growth pattern, the same narrowing of the dental arch; and gaping mouth. Harvold repeated these experiments, this time keeping animals obstructed for two years. They fared even worse. Along the way, he took a lot of pictures. The photographs are heart-wrenching, not only for the sake of the poor monkeys, but because they also offer such a clear reflection of what happens to our own species: after just a few months, faces grew long, slack-jawed, and glazed over.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[{"title":"Breath Book","slug":"breath-book","childMdx":{"excerpt":"Ancient Quotes On Breathing Ancient Texts On Breathing Breathing and Freedive Why Breathing Is Important The Decline Of Breathing In Theâ€¦"}}],"outboundReferenceNotes":[]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Adam's Brain"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"animal-experiments-on-breathing"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
