data-emotion-css="19iowwu">.css-19iowwu{color:#333;color:#333;}</style><p class="css-19iowwu">Rogan: What What made you want to write this, like where did this come from?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Nestor: There&#x27;s actually two things about 10 years ago 11 years ago. I had this really weird experience. I was in San Francisco, a lot of breathwork yoga stuff going on there and I kept getting pneumonia, so a doctor friend suggested a breathing class might help.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I didn&#x27;t know much about this but went down signed up. And was sitting in the corner of this studio cold room legs crossed breathing in this rhythmic pattern. Nothing crazy just and then really slow and I sweated through my t-shirt to my socks. My hair was sopping wet sweat all over my face. So I went back to her and I said what happened like your doctor you should know this and she said, oh you must have had a fever or the room must have been too hot. So she No idea but I didn&#x27;t know what to do with that story. So I just kind of filed it away forgot about it for a number of years until I met some free divers.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">These are people who have through the Power of Will and Naval themselves to hold their breath for six seven eight minutes at a time and dive to depths far below what any scientists thought possible. So I thought wow there&#x27;s something in breathing here that I don&#x27;t know about and I figured other people might not know about as well.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really interesting. You know, I&#x27;ve known a bunch of free divers and I&#x27;ve known a bunch of Jiu-Jitsu people that got really into yoga primarily because it Hicks and Gracie Hicks and Gracie. Do you know he is yeah. Oh, yeah famous probably the most famous of the of the like the classic Jiu-Jitsu people he&#x27;s known as being the very best. He was like one of the original real pioneers of Jiu-Jitsu in America as well.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And there&#x27;s this documentary on him called choke. Have you seen it?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I have not now.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s really fascinating this documentary. He&#x27;s doing all this crazy stomach breath stuff that Yogi stuff, you know because he&#x27;s real he&#x27;s really into yoga as well for flexibility and balance and all those different things and he was probably the first guy to introduce yoga to jiu jitsu as well, but him and his son who&#x27;s also a world champion in Jiu-Jitsu just stressed constantly that it&#x27;s all about the breath and that breathing is it&#x27;s everything that it&#x27;s everything. For jiu jitsu. It&#x27;s everything for martial arts everything for your mindset.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You&#x27;re going to find that in the foundation of so many different sports. I think a lot of that has been forgotten another coaches in the 50s used to have their Runners take a big mouthful of water run around the track and then they&#x27;d have to spit out that same amount of water into a cup to force them to breathe through their nose, to force them to move their diaphragms up and down a little more because breathing is so essential to the recovery their endurance in their performance in what Of the things I found interesting about your book was the experiment with plugging up the nose for what did you guys do it for a month?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So what it was 10 days 10 days and that tend to I my nose was broken most of my life. I had a useless nose till I was 40 and then I got an operation to have my deviated septum corrected and turbinates shaved down and then it changed my life. It really did like I didn&#x27;t realize like what like the term mouth breather is a really interesting term because it&#x27;s term for a moron.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But I felt like a moron like after I got my nose fixed. I was like, why didn&#x27;t I do this before like I was robbing myself of oxygen.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and there&#x27;s so much science supporting how injury is it is to constantly be breathing through your mouth. There&#x27;s there&#x27;s no debate about that. But what people don&#x27;t realize is about twenty-five to fifty percent of the population between we breathe through their mouth. They don&#x27;t realize that neurological problems that this causes the respiratory problems this causes problems with snoring.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Sleep apnea even metabolic disorders. I mean it goes on and on and on so I had been talking to the chief of rhinology research at Stanford. We done many interviews over a series of months. He&#x27;s a big nose guy. So he said this is the most amazing organ. No one&#x27;s talking about it at the NIH. There&#x27;s no school for studying the nose and its effects and he thought that that was criminal.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So he had warned me how bad mouth breathing was but no one knew how quickly that damage came on. So we knew that After years, it can change the structure of your face. It&#x27;s so common in kids that has a term called adenoid face. If you see these kids with very long faces because they&#x27;ve been mouth breathing so long that their faces have actually the musculature and the Skeletor has have changed changes your skeleton. Yeah. Yeah, it makes it creates a longer face.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So and that that also makes these people much more apt to snoring and sleep apnea. So but but no one knew if a month of mouth-breathing would be bad a year like how soon those those Issues came on so I asked him I said well, why don&#x27;t you test it you&#x27;re one of the best universities in the world you have the means to do this and he thought in his words it would be unethical because he knew how damaging that it could be for people and so I volunteered I said, why don&#x27;t you test it on me? I&#x27;ll get somebody else to do it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They had no money for this. So we had to pay for this study just to experience what what that was like and the point wasn&#x27;t due to do some like Jackass stunts. It was to Lowell ourselves a new position my body certainly knew I think I was mouth breathing through much of my youth and that 25 to 50 percent of the population knows and to actually measure what happens now do you think there was some bacterial growth that was inside your nose as well from this do you think that some of that could be attributed to just the act of plugging the nose because you physically plugged it it&#x27;s not like you chose to breathe out of your mouth you actually like seeing you closed up the opening.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s right, and it could No one knows for sure because the less you use your nose the less you&#x27;re going to be able to use your nose just like any other muscle. So when people start habitually breathing through their mouths their noses are going to start to close up and we know this from the doctor of speech language pathology at Stanford.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">She measured people who had laryngectomy holes drilled in their throats, so they could breathe. She found between two months and two years their noses were completely blocked 0 are coming in. So the more you use it the more you&#x27;re going to be able to use it. So the Actually use it the more apt you will you will be to have problems with what is the process of well, why does the nose close up?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It would seem that it&#x27;s a whole like why would that whole clothes?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s not in use those turbinates. All those tissues just just start closing up.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And so using your nose actually makes the opening wider.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Absolutely really for ya absolute.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">My nose got physically wider after my operation. It&#x27;s really strange. Like I was look back on the photos from when I was t on my actual physical and I attributed it to the fact that they put these big foam things and these plastic spacers in there because the doctor that it did the operation he&#x27;s for forget the period of time afterwards. I had to have these things stuffed into my nose and this plastic that was sort of sutured in place to hold it into position and I attributed that to why my nose got wider, but I noticed it like within the year two afterwards.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">My fucking nose is wider like it&#x27;s different. Like if I look at older pictures of myself, my nose was more narrow and now it&#x27;s more flared out and I felt like it was because of that but now that you&#x27;re saying this now I&#x27;m thinking maybe it&#x27;s just from breathing out of it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well surgical interventions are gonna open that are way there&#x27;s no doubt about that. But but we know the more that you breathe through your nose the more that it&#x27;s going to open up and you can see this with people who are habitual mouth-breathers who are also joggers who have just been breathing through their mouths for four decades.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They art breathing through the nose at the beginning. It&#x27;s really really hard.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, I can&#x27;t do this.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">This is awful. Then weeks go by months go by and their nose is open up and and allows them to breathe through the nose in the benefits of that. There are innumerable so many benefits of nasal breathing not only oxygen but it helps defend your body humidifies are conditions are on and on and on and this is something I just don&#x27;t think a lot of people realize and and from the researchers I&#x27;ve been talking to they were a bit frustrated to seeing so many chronic Tied to mouth breathing and how so many of those could either be improved upon or sometimes outright cured by switching the pathway in which you breathe so does breathing through your nose make your actual nostril opening wider.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I don&#x27;t know that I am and I haven&#x27;t seen any papers on that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So it&#x27;s but my nostril holes and everything is probably just from the surgical intervention and stuffing it with plastic and stretching it out and I would assume so yeah now what Wim Hof when you reference in the book, he doesn&#x27;t give a fuck about Mount about nose breathing or mouth-breathing. He just goes just breathe motherfucker breathe.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, that&#x27;s what he says.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Oh, yeah, I practiced his motive breathing all the time. I&#x27;m used to having, you know, his little voice in my head.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Why doesn&#x27;t he care about breathing from the nose of the mouth?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He just wants you to breathe because if we&#x27;re breathing 25,000 times a day, if you&#x27;re taking five hundred of those breaths through your mouth. It&#x27;s not going to really make any impact on you. I&#x27;m talking about habitual mouth Brian.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And I&#x27;m just talking about through breathing exercises.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He&#x27;s so what he&#x27;s done is he wants to make this easy and accessible for people so many people can&#x27;t breathe through their noses. So they go they can&#x27;t get that breath in those 30 huge breaths you need to take right? They take too long to do it. So he says it doesn&#x27;t matter don&#x27;t pay attention. You need to get that breath in you need to expand your lungs and for the rest of the time, you know, I know the benefits of nasal breathing that habitual breathing is so important.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Health it seems so strange to me reading your book that I&#x27;m just learning this in terms of like I mean, I&#x27;ve been doing Athletics my whole life. How do I not know that breathing through the nose is more beneficial. How do coaches not know this.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">This is something I just got running up against over and over again. And when I first started writing this book my friends who are journalists and authors. They said you&#x27;re writing a book about breathing. What why would you write a book about birds squawking?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a good new book about walk.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Really?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So so they were ripping on me quite quite a bit until they heard some of the details of it and the stuff is like has been right in front of us the whole time and it&#x27;s so obvious that no one&#x27;s really paying attention to it and the scientific Foundation all the research is there and that&#x27;s what makes these these researchers these scientists. So frustrated as they we have 50 years of Rock Solid science here showing the problems with mouth-breathing showing the problems with snoring and sleep apnea.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Apnea, no one&#x27;s really been paying attention. We&#x27;re treating all these separate problems that are associated with these core issues and we&#x27;re not looking at the core issue. And I think that breathing has to be considered along with diet and exercise as a pillar of health because even if you eat keto vegan paleo, whatever even if you exercise all the time, if you&#x27;re not breathing, right, you&#x27;re never really going to be healthy.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">We know that to be the truth so air comes through your mouth air comes through your nose.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What is the difference between the air coming through your nose? Okay.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So your nose if you were to take your fist, you&#x27;ve got a really big fist, so someone with a slightly smaller Fist and to take that Fist and imagine just pushing it inside of your head. That&#x27;s about the volume of your nose and all the sinus cavities. So they even stretch up above your eyes so volume of your fist, that&#x27;s crazy. It&#x27;s about a billiard ball.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So so a little less depends on what size fish you have, right? So so all and and they call it the nasal conchae. Cuz it looks exactly like a seashell if you were to split a seashell and in half and look at it. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in your nose and all of the stuff evolved this way for a reason so that air that comes in through the nose is slow down.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s filtered. It&#x27;s humidified and its condition. So by the time it gets to your lungs your lungs can absorb that oxygen so much easier and that the nose is really the first line of defense another amazing thing with a no Is it produces something called nitric oxide, which is this wonderful molecule. That is a vasodilator that plays an essential role in oxygen delivery and also helps battle off viruses bacteria and other pathogens M. So this is all happening in the nose and slowing down that are all of these other functions allow us to gain about 20% more oxygen breathing through the nose than breathing through the mouth so you can breathe less and get more by breathing through The nose.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Wow, so breathing through the mouth, even though you know, you&#x27;re filling your lungs up, even though you&#x27;re cool. You&#x27;re taking a big deep breath. You&#x27;re filling your lungs up. You&#x27;re not getting as much oxygen.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That&#x27;s right, because you can over breathe when people at a gym or when people are jogging CM Really Gonna Get the maximum amount of oxygen in that&#x27;s not what happened. What is happening to your body? So you are offloading the CO2 by offloading too much CO2. Causing constriction in your circulation.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So right now if we were to breathe 30 huge breaths, you&#x27;ll feel some tingling in your head. You&#x27;ll feel some maybe your fingertips will get cool. Your toes will get tool cool. That&#x27;s not from an increase of oxygens the opposite that&#x27;s happening that&#x27;s from a decrease of circulation. So your body wants to be in Balance you want to have the right amount of CO2 and oxygen for Optimum delivery and that&#x27;s what the nose helps you to do.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That was one of the craziest things about the book. We are talking about Yogi&#x27;s that were able all to vary the temperature between each hand now on the same hand out in the same hand same hand one area was gray.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">The other was red. So in the same in the same not even this in this God on the same hand and you know, when I came across this people are saying this is impossible. There&#x27;s you know, who did the study some guy in Taos in his garage? No, it was at the manager Clinic which was the world&#x27;s at least in the u.s. The largest psychiatric Research facility at the time and navy physicists did these tests was reported in the New York Times have been replicated.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They haven&#x27;t found someone who had the powers of Swami Rama. They found I think whims about as close as we&#x27;ve gotten to that guy.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So this is something that is like, you know, like Michael Jordan didn&#x27;t start out good at basketball, right? He learned he practiced he got better and this you could say the same thing perhaps about breathing for sure and and just look at freedivers, right?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I was out this my first foray into that world was that the world free diving championship and grease and you see these people some of them are short some of them are tall some of my large small. I mean from all walks of life every imaginable country something like 30 countries had representatives there and these people weren&#x27;t born with these enormous lungs, right? They did this by The Power of Will by Breathing and expanding their lung capacity and so once I saw them all of these people able to do this, once they explained to me, they said, you know, the benefits of breathing go beyond just diving deep it can allow us to heal our bodies of problems. It can allow us super endurance. It can allow us to do all these things that we&#x27;ve been told are medically impossible and I heard this I didn&#x27;t believe them but I spent several years in the field. Old talking to people at Stanford Harvard, you know the best the the leaders in the field and finding this research and what they told me was absolutely true the idea that there&#x27;s a guy like this Swami Rama as I say to him that he can do that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s very appealing to me very interesting to me because even though breathing has been around for a long time, you know, everybody knows that there&#x27;s different styles of breathing and holotropic breathing is pretty popular and I always think even though people know the benefits of many things very few people go all the way with stuff like, you know, if you if you just talked to an average person akan. Someone run 250 miles most people say no, but I know people that have done it so it is possible but you you have to find someone who go all the way and do it for a long time a long time.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So this this Army Rama guy there has to be someone else like that out there.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and the probably not on Facebook, right? No, they&#x27;re probably not ransomware.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Absolutely.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Absolutely. So this was a guy who grew up in the Himalayas who by the age of four was studying yoga. He was meditating. He was breathing. So he lived his entire life in that World Learning these tricks and he got so good at it that he was able on command to make his heart. Beat 300 times a minute 300 times a minute to so it was so fast. They were looking at the EKG readout and they said he&#x27;s stopped his heart then they looked at it a little closer and said no actually it&#x27;s beating 300 times a minute and then he would just snap out of it. So these story sounds so impossible. They sounded impossible to me, but it&#x27;s all documented. So I just don&#x27;t know in the modern world.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Do we have the capacity? Is there someone out there who&#x27;s willing to stay off? Phone stay off Netflix and focus on one thing for 30 years. I I&#x27;m not sure maybe hopefully but who knows that was what was so interesting listening to the book.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I was like God I want to know what&#x27;s possible but I don&#x27;t want to do it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Let other people do it, right?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I don&#x27;t have that kind of time man, but I believe there&#x27;s something to it because my own personal benefits that I&#x27;ve gotten from breathing exercises is one of the reasons why it was that that&#x27;s what led me to your book and especially in the sauna over the last year. I got a sauna in my house and I&#x27;ve gotten really into I have a song here as well.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But I got really into doing these daily sessions of a hundred and eighty degrees for 25 to 30 minutes. And as you can imagine the last 10 minutes are really uncomfortable, you know when you get down when it&#x27;s 15 minutes and you know, you got 10 more minutes ago. It&#x27;s not fun, you know, but when I breathe when I concentrate on these these breathing exercises and I have a bunch of different ones that I do and one of them that I do is I concentrate on taking shallow breaths and holding my breath for as long as I can and there&#x27;s this panicked moment where you feel like you have to breathe, but you really don&#x27;t you really don&#x27;t you just got to get over that Panic moment and then there&#x27;s like a weird calm that comes over and you can last much much longer than you can and then when I do breathe in I just Concentrate on doing it slowly. Don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t let myself panic and through like time just flies by it&#x27;s crazy time flies by and because I&#x27;m thinking about the breathing.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m barely paying attention to the fact that I&#x27;m profusely sweating and my body&#x27;s not freaking out as much so I do these little weird tricks that I play on myself inside the sauna and in concentrating on breathing and long deep breaths through my nose and holding it and then long exhales through my nose what I&#x27;m doing that It makes everything easier. It&#x27;s weird. It&#x27;s a it&#x27;s like it makes your body for whatever reason more accepting of the extreme heat.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, that&#x27;s what I love about breathing is it allows us these levers into systems that we can&#x27;t otherwise control. So the autonomic nervous system is supposed to be beyond our control. It&#x27;s called autonomic automatic can&#x27;t control it. We can through breathing. You may not be able to control your Liver function or your stomach or your heart?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But when you breathe a certain way, you can influence all those functions and you can start taking control of these other elements of your body as women is showing not only the nervous system but with immune function, so all of this was supposed to be impossible until he showed up and said, you know, why don&#x27;t you test me instead of just just talking we have measurements.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">We have equipment to test the stuff we can measure it we can study it if we can study it we can prove It&#x27;s right or wrong and that that&#x27;s what I find is so interesting and accessible about breathing as well. Even if someone has a pulse ox or you have a heart rate variability monitor, you can breathe in certain ways and instantly see what it does to your body. So people who say that this is a placebo effect don&#x27;t understand that this is a biological function that you&#x27;re taking control of and if you can elicit such a strong response and a couple of minutes, imagine what you can do in a couple of days or a couple of weeks or a couple of months.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s and we&#x27;re starting to see that with women some of his minions and other people who have been breathing as a way to heal themselves of chronic conditions.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah women is a really interesting sort of he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a great spokesperson for because he drinks Heineken and eat spaghetti. Like he&#x27;s a weirdo, you know what I mean? And he swears a lot and he&#x27;s fun and he&#x27;s silly what I like about him is the fact that he does. Seem like this mystical person that you&#x27;ll you can&#x27;t relate to he&#x27;s very relatable.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and I think that that&#x27;s where breathing really needs to move from this this new a Genus into more pragmatic and practical area and he is woman&#x27;s like the Everyman right and he&#x27;s gone and discovered these things and now he&#x27;s showing people how to use them and he&#x27;s very clear that he did not invent these methods these methods have been around for at least a thousand years, especially to mow.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">There&#x27;s documentation that goes back thousand years twelve hundred years of people doing this to heat themselves up there. Like I don&#x27;t have a jacket. I don&#x27;t have anything else to wear. I&#x27;m freezing. How do I keep my core temperature warm in these freezing temperatures explain to Mona people?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Sure. So so to mow is a breathing practice that is used to build heat in the body build inner heat and it was the first documentation was from this guy. Naropa who about 11 Eleven Hundred Years Ago went off on a spear spiritual pilgrimage ended up in the Himalayas needed to heat himself and use this practice and it stayed in the monasteries for for hundreds of years until this Belgian French opera singer Anarchist around the 1900s a mouthful. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to include a few more because she did a whole buncha.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">She&#x27;s Anna Friel of feminism. I mean you you name it? She she ran the gamut so but she went on a spiritual Pilgrimage for 14 years in the Himalayas when she was in her 40s. This is in the 1900s, which was just like unheard of wow, and she discovered this this thing. She said she was able to use this to not eat or drink anything at elevations of above 8,000 18,000 feet and walk for about 19 hours at a time there. No fact-checkers there to prove it and nobody believed her until Herbert Benson at Harvard had heard enough of these stories in the 1980s.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That he went out and tested these monks and found out that they could do exactly what they had been told that they were supposed to do, you know for thousands of years and what is the technique of tumor? The technique is it&#x27;s very similar to Wim Hof&#x27;s version of to mow the monks do it in a slightly different way.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They slow down their nervous system and Benson found that they were able to slow their metabolism by sixty percent. So it&#x27;s lower than anything that has ever been measured before so they just do that. And focus on a fire within the body and breathe out. Sometimes they breathe a little more you can see videotapes of this for people who don&#x27;t believe this stuff.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You can see video tapes of this guy in a cold room. No shirt on sweating they put a wet sheet on him and he drives the sheet within about a half an hour because he&#x27;s so hot and he&#x27;s only doing this through breathing and when you making this noise, like what is the technique like your breathing?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Is this like an 80/20 thing where you fully fill the lungs? Let 80% or let 20% out and then breathe in again and let 20% out like that kind of that version is much more complicated than the type that the bond to mow monks use.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So whims method does the exact same thing but he&#x27;s stimulating the nervous system. So his is 30 huge breaths breath hold as long as you can one big breath in 15 second hold and then out and what are these monks doing? They&#x27;re doing a slower version of it. So I have not practiced that version. Of to mow, why not because it&#x27;s really complicated and to do it, right you need to get the master there and I try to contact these guys and they didn&#x27;t want did not want me there reporting on what they were doing.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What does kind of feel like if they knew the benefits of this they would want the world to know you would think so, but what would we do with it?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Right we found it. We commercial commercialize it and and so so maybe they don&#x27;t want the world to know, you know, maybe they want to keep a few things in there.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Pocket so what do you know of what they&#x27;re doing? Why is it so complicated that because so much of this is a mental practice. It&#x27;s joins the breathing know some sort of a thought process that goes on absolutely and and to get that visualization and to be able to focus for that amount of time takes a lot of time.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I think one of the reasons that whims process is so easy and accessible you can think about whatever you want while you&#x27;re breathing that way you think about emails think about what you&#x27;re going to have for dinner and as long as you Othing that way it&#x27;ll do what it does and their method requires you to think about very specific things.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Think about a fire inside of your belly moving your belly in and out but you so, you know this I don&#x27;t know every single step know I do what other steps could there be like it is there there&#x27;s there&#x27;s fast breathing their slow breathing and there&#x27;s a ton of mental focus. So there&#x27;s like 20 steps that that you have to go through to really get this right.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Are we in danger of losing? In this like it seems like you know about it, but you don&#x27;t know how to do it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I don&#x27;t know. I know the elements of it, right and what I&#x27;ve read online and who knows how true that stuff is, right? There&#x27;s a few guys teaching. This one&#x27;s in Colorado and the others are in India as the in Boulder.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He must be: he has to be somewhere else so so but but you think about how many languages that were losing right along with those languages we&#x27;re losing now.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Knowledge very very quickly and this is happening every decade. And so especially if you consider what&#x27;s happened to Tibet to these civilizations that have been there practicing this technology of breathing for thousands of years a lot of its just disappearing.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah. That&#x27;s a shame. Have you thought about going there and like hanging out with those guys and I&#x27;d love to can&#x27;t can&#x27;t do that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Now get ride.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Of course.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I spent some time, you know the book I talk about to moan about half of one chapter and I wanted to Cover whims been written about all over the place people know as method, but I wanted to look at it at the science from it and look at the history of it because because the how was one story but to me it was more interesting to find why what&#x27;s happening to the body?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Why does this happen? Where does it come from? Yeah, that&#x27;s what I focused on.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So this gentleman the teachers in Colorado. Where did he learn it from?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He must have learned it from from the great sages, you know and arm Salah or Tibet or maybe he&#x27;s like one of those Kung Fu guys just fix it or maybe he&#x27;s just yeah, that&#x27;s Faker Faker.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, I could just made something up could be I don&#x27;t want to accuse him but in the martial arts world that happens a lot at least it used to happen a lot is a lot of fakers that have you know, the thing in martial arts world was always Chi and you know, you talked about that in the book as well about people having this this power that&#x27;s cheat touch and it was 99.9% horseshit meaning that most of the people that were talking. Talking about it. We&#x27;re really teaching sort of a fraudulent made up version of martial arts. And there&#x27;s a bunch of Instagram pages that are dedicated to these people. It&#x27;s really to make fun of them because it&#x27;s so strange. It&#x27;s there&#x27;s it&#x27;s such a weird thing that these people do where they have huge class fulls of people and they pretend to have this death touch and they touch people and and the people are they&#x27;re essentially in a cult and so they spasm they fall to the ground and it always made me laugh, but there was a part of me.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That says there is a there&#x27;s a thing in the body and this thing can be activated. Whether it&#x27;s whether you want to call it energy or Spirit. There&#x27;s there&#x27;s different mindsets and inspiration and through these different mindsets and inspiration. You can achieve some pretty spectacular results physical results and people that are in this mindset.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They they can perform better. There&#x27;s something about them in terms. Martial arts. There&#x27;s something about that. So I&#x27;ve always wondered like if someone really pursued this without all the nonsense without all the Shekinah re if you really pursued this what could be done.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I think the first thing you do is get these people in the lab and they&#x27;re claiming to have these the skills that are incredible. Why not measure it I mean, it&#x27;s not that hard to measure stuff. And so if they deny being having any any lab work done or having it be measured then I think you have To be a little apprehensive, you know, and and that&#x27;s something that so much of this technology is cheap now to get so even if if you were to show up with with two thousand dollars worth of equipment you could see if there was some scientific basis to what these people are doing, but from my understanding I didn&#x27;t go down to the chi hole too deep but a lot of these people aren&#x27;t showing up and and offering volunteering to have their skills, you know tested and and that&#x27;s how science works. You have to test it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It has to be replicable.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, it&#x27;s everybody wants to be Swami Rama but nobody wants to do what Swami Rama did right?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah who wants to sit and it well some people do sit in a cave for 30 years, right? He would go away for years at a time in a dark cave and just sit there and breathe. So I just in the Modern Age. I just don&#x27;t know Rick that guy must have been kind of would love to talk to him. Yeah, he had it all down because there are people that can do that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You know, they&#x27;re like the Unabomber breathing, you know, they just has moved to the woods and just rub it without the negativity.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But but what was what was cool about him is he wasn&#x27;t the only one who could do this. So there were researchers in the 20s and in the 40s who went out with a bunch of equipment whatever equipment they could Cobble together and tested other yogis who were able to do this exact same thing, right? So so Swami was part of this long lineage of people who had this knowledge. Is it still there could be but again, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s on Line, I think you really have to get out in the weeds. And and earn these people&#x27;s trust in order to get that story.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And what is what is the history of these people doing this? Like what was their initial motivation?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I mean, is there a written history of this the earliest evidence that we have for breathing practices dates back about 4,000 or 5,000 years from these little statuettes in the Indus Valley, which is in Northern India. So there was this huge thriving Ization they had paved roads. They had running water. They were dealing with tin and copper and they had no in this in this whole civilization. They still have not found any political or governmental buildings. They haven&#x27;t found any religious iconography. So these people in some ways could have been more advanced than we are now and they had all of these figures of these people in these these yoga poses with their stomachs out. So that&#x27;s how they date the earliest archaeological Of that and since then then all of these practices were moved into the rig Veda and and all of the earliest yoga text and they were codified in The Yoga sutras of patanjali is that&#x27;s where a lot of the yoga methods come from. That&#x27;s about 2,000 years old.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So the methods predate all that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Oh, I&#x27;m sure they predate probably anything that that has been in writing wouldn&#x27;t is it that&#x27;s what so curious to me.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What makes me so curious if you really think about what life must have been like back then the when they were creating this you would think that people were hunting and Gathering it was probably a very hard life.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well not not in that Civilization, right but they got to a point where they had some sort of Agriculture or some structures and building but how did they get to the point where because the rest of the world didn&#x27;t obviously didn&#x27;t do this.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">This is not like common practice in Germany or in Italy or in all these other It&#x27;s like what made these people focus on breathwork so much.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, it could have been but we just haven&#x27;t found anything related to that yet. Right. So if you think about hunter-gatherers we&#x27;re imagining them is man, they&#x27;re just working all day. They&#x27;re hunting all day. They&#x27;re Gathering they weren&#x27;t from from what I know. And from what I&#x27;ve seen of the science, they&#x27;re probably three or four hours of work, you know, and then you have no other distractions to spend time and build these systems of breathing and health, which is what started in ancient China which is what started in India which is what started in ancient Greece think about all the distractions. We&#x27;re dealing with today constant interruptions.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">If you&#x27;ve already done your work for the day, there&#x27;s nothing else to do you&#x27;re going to get more interest in you&#x27;re going to have the time to do some empirical studies to see what works and what doesn&#x27;t it just seems to me that like learning something like that learning something like prolonged.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Work in the benefits of it mean it seems like this is a really long-term practice. That doesn&#x27;t show you immediate benefits.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yes, and no I think that you can take someone who has a serious problem. Maybe someone who&#x27;s already very fit. It&#x27;s going to take a while to really see those big benefits. We see that with athletes with nasal breathing takes them weeks or sometimes months to really see gains in performance. But if you&#x27;ve got someone with a chronic condition like asthma or anxiety who are struggling to breathe every Single day and you teach them some basic breathing some normal breathing patterns.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Their lives can be absolutely transformed. We&#x27;ve seen this in study after study. So these people their breathing has become so disrupted their breathing in such an unhealthy way that they don&#x27;t know what proper breathing is and just shifting that has a tremendous impact. So for people like that, they can see the benefits in a couple hours maybe even less than that someone with high blood pressure right now.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">If they&#x27;re sitting at home, they can take their blood pressure. And then breathe at a rate of about six seconds in six seconds out take their blood pressure after that and there&#x27;s a good chance. The blood pressure is going to go down. I&#x27;ve seen mind go down 10 10 or 15 point just by breathing because your body is operating in its most efficient way that way and no have over how long a period of time would it take your blood pressure to drop that much after a few minutes. I found it about about three or four minutes of breathing this way and they found theirs theirs.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Vices that they sell now which trains people to sit down take a seat and breathe in a certain pattern for 10 or 15 minutes and they&#x27;ve shown marked decreases in blood pressure by that. You don&#x27;t need this device to do this. It helped remind you all you need to do is focus on your breath, right? We have the technology in our heads. We have lungs. We have a nose we can use that to really help optimize our health.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And what is the benefit for asthmatics?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">The benefit for asthmatics is they traditionally oftentimes mouth breathe not all the time. They very often times are breathing too much. So seen asthmatic that&#x27;s usually how they breathe because they are offloading all of the CO2 by offloading that CO2. They are causing constriction and they&#x27;re so paranoid that they&#x27;re going to have an asthma attack that every time they feel it coming on. They go guess what happens when you start breathing more More you&#x27;re causing more constriction.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So they teach them to take control of their breath to relax at those times.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So that&#x27;s what hyperventilating is.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yes, and there&#x27;s a study done about 10 years ago is one of the best studies that came across where they took a hundred twenty asthmatics and the technology. They used to treat them was breathing. They would have them bring around this kept na matter which would gauge their CO2 every time their CO2 started getting low, which meant they were breathing too much. They would have them slow down.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Down and and slow down their breathing within a month. They had a significant effect on asthma attacks and also respiratory Health. There are ways got larger. So just just by breathing and this is there&#x27;s a well-known studies available for anyone to look up.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So what do you know? What causes asthma is it just a genetic.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s an allergic reaction. It&#x27;s an inflammatory reaction. So there&#x27;s different types of asthma there&#x27;s allergic asthma there&#x27;s exercise-induced asthma which is caused by breathing too much and a lot of people think I was born with asthma I&#x27;m stuck with asthma that&#x27;s that could be true for a lot of people who don&#x27;t want to take some some additional measures to help Abate the symptoms of that asthma and I think we&#x27;re just finding now a lot of really legit solid science showing that breathing is implicated both in the onset of asthma but it can also be used as a tool to help attenuate the symptoms of it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So when you&#x27;re it&#x27;s like if you&#x27;re talking to someone with asthma what would you like my Hannibal he has he was here yesterday was telling a story about freaking out on mushrooms and hyperventilating and had to get his inhaler. What would you tell someone like him who&#x27;s an asthmatic?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I would first tell him. I&#x27;m not a breathing therapist. I&#x27;m not a doctor and he should continue going to his doctor and taking his bronchodilator. So I&#x27;m a journalist who went into this world with zero Slant with zero objective. Then I would tell him after that disclaimer that I would seek a therapist who has And dealing with asthmatics and using breathing to help them. There is a common they are out there and and they&#x27;re starting to grow papworth method was developed in England in the 1960s really effective a system called buteyko. Breathing has shown there&#x27;s a lot of quackery and buteyko. So be careful who you&#x27;re using.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">A lot of people have taken up buteyko techniques and appointed themselves as breathing therapist, and they don&#x27;t know. Know that they don&#x27;t know the basis of how exactly what is buteyko buteyko is a system of allowing you to help you to breathe less and debrief slowly and it&#x27;s been pretty extensively studied with asthma in particular. It&#x27;s good for hypertension as well.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So I would find a therapist who has a knowledge of this Patrick McEwan has been doing this for 20 years. He&#x27;s Rock Solid he&#x27;s done the science and he cured his own allergies severe asthma. Allergies, he said why the hell isn&#x27;t anyone else doing this and so he stopped what he was a business major and stopped and and this is he&#x27;s written like for books on this stuff.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s art. What&#x27;s his name? Again? Patrick McEwen Patrick Yeah, Irish dude and breathing less see that sounds very counterintuitive to people when you say breathing less like what are you talking about? You supposed to breathe a lot right more you breathe the more air you get right? Yeah.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">This is such a contrarian concept it took me months to Really figure out what was going on here. So most of us breathe too much just like most of the population is eating too much when we&#x27;re taking in that much air. We&#x27;re just breathing it back out. So 75% of the oxygen we take in we breathe back out.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So if we&#x27;re breathing if we&#x27;re just sitting here now and I&#x27;m doing this I&#x27;m not gaining any Oxygen. I&#x27;m actually making it harder for my body to offload oxygen into the tissues muscles and organs.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Is that because it takes time. Your body to take the oxygen in through the breath and disperse it through the body.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, it&#x27;s two things. So it&#x27;s the CO2 when I&#x27;m breathing like this. I&#x27;m offloading too much CO2 and without that CO2. I&#x27;m not getting that vasodilation. I&#x27;m not getting that circulation which is why just doing that a little lightness in my head. You know, my fingers get a little tingly just doing this just from that. Yeah, try keep going.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So as you&#x27;re doing that you&#x27;re going to hear in a feel a little dizzy. You&#x27;re probably feel some circulation problems in your hands and fingers.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You can do this for two hours and you&#x27;ll really see.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And say so the point the point by breathing less and deeply is to optimize each of those breaths as much as you can to give your body more time to extract that oxygen and you want to do that through the nose because that pressure breathing in helps the lungs in that gas exchange.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So if you know someone that has a deviated septum you would instantly recommend them get that fixed.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">This is this is what I have. So 75% of the population has a deviated septum that is clearly visible to the naked eye. So I&#x27;ve had mine nose broken two or three times. So I&#x27;m as when they took a CAT scan of my head. I&#x27;m as more messed up as anyone Nayak said you were the perfect candidate for surgery, but I tried to see what I could do outside of surgery. I know people who have been absent just like you feather helped transform by it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s very important, but there are also people who don&#x27;t necessarily need it and should start by practicing some breathing methods or something other than surgery. I did not know interesting and and I changed my Airways and I changed how my nose worked over the Course of a year, we took cat-scans before and after just by breathing, you know how people get cauliflower ear, you know that from calcified blood gets trapped inside the tissues.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">My nose was filled like that. So I really did need surgery. I&#x27;m and my nose had probably been broken.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I broke my nose with the first time when I was five falling down a flight of stairs and then a lifetime of Combat Sports. I don&#x27;t know how many times I broke it. It easily could be more than a dozen.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s and that&#x27;s why you are a perfect candidate for this. And it changed your life.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, but it was surgery.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, I know but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about. Surgical interventions are absolutely necessary for a large part of the population.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I had one quarter of one nostril that was open my right nostril is useless like totally closed up. I mean when I would try to breathe like nothing would go through that&#x27;s bad news. Yeah, go to yoga class to go breathe through your nose Mike. My nose is useless and if you listen to like if someone hears me from like the 50&#x27;s. Factor days and you listen to my voice. It&#x27;s a different voice.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s more nasally voice because my nose is stuffed all the time.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I had to breathe out of my mouth, but for someone like you now, you know the benefits of nasal breathing, right and what just the cardio benefits alone was crazy.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s like I gained 10 percent cardio instantly.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and I&#x27;ve heard this numerous times by so many people. So what you&#x27;re doing when you&#x27;re breathing through the nose is you&#x27;re slowing down that breath you you&#x27;re taking in Less Breath, but you&#x27;re using more of it. It so by breathing less you&#x27;re going to be able to lower your heart rate and we know this if anyone has a pulse oximeter at home, you would think that breathing six breaths a minute, which is about a third of what&#x27;s considered normal.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You think there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m getting enough oxygen right that&#x27;s impossible put on a pulse ox and watch what happens and what I&#x27;ve found is your oxygen is either going to stay the same or sometimes go up. We even got on stationary bikes with a on the Stanford experiment and we&#x27;re trying to see if we could breathe six breaths a minute.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Going as hard as hard as we could and watching what happened to our oxygen and our oxygen did not go down. Once we got to about three or four breaths per minute as start going down. As long as you have these huge breasts right this huge circle your and you can work out that way and they found dr. John Dewey yard did a bunch of studies of this in the 90s and found for cyclists who were normally breathing 47 times a minute. They were able to breathe it 14 times a minute by nasal breathing.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So their endurance increase the performance increase in the recovery increase the instinct when you&#x27;re exhausted is to so what you&#x27;re saying is you have to fight that instinct and breathe through your nose and you will Cover just as well.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m saying you need to slowly acclimate your body to this that need to breathe is not dictated by oxygen and this is another thing that&#x27;s really hard to get your head around. It&#x27;s dictated by carbon dioxide. So if you were to hold your breath right now and you feel that need to breathe that&#x27;s dictated by Rising levels of CO2 not by oxygen.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That was another really fascinating aspect of your book the importance of carbon dioxide. I had always thought of carbon dioxide. As a waste product when you were talking about that one researcher that was saying the carbon dioxide is probably more important than oxygen for life. I was like, what is what what is this?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Like what the guys from Yale to Yandell Henderson check out his work.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s rock-solid its debts, but that&#x27;s so counterintuitive right to what a normal person believes to be true.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and I wouldn&#x27;t pick between oxygen. In CO2, are you going to do you&#x27;re getting going to lose either way?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But so too is not just a waste product.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Now, you need a balance of these two things. Everyone&#x27;s focused on oxygen which is why you see at an airport in Singapore and oxygen bar. You see linebacker on the you know on the side of the field huffing pure oxygen that oxygen for healthy body is not doing anything you&#x27;re exhaling it back out.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So when you go like to a high-altitude place and they give you oxygen that&#x27;s nonsense.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">No, that&#x27;s completely different high altitude. There&#x27;s less oxygen you absolutely need it. So no at sea level for health right now. You probably have 97 percent O2 blood SATs, right? I probably do too if you think about that huffing pure oxygen it might bump you up one or two percent but that oxygen has nowhere to go. If you don&#x27;t have CO2 off those bars kind of disappeared didn&#x27;t they like these to have those in Vegas like you bet tubes up your nose and sit there like an idiot.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Remember doing that going to trying to convince myself. It was doing something.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, well, the lowlights are doing the air conditioning is doing something the chaise lounge that you&#x27;re sitting on is doing laughing. Yeah. Yeah relaxing you but I was completely stumped by this and I&#x27;m not talking about people with emphysema or at altaf quarters. I&#x27;m talking about healthy people at sea level around sea level and I kept asking pulmonologist. My father-in-law is a pulmonologist. So I asked him all of these questions and he&#x27;s just like it&#x27;s the biggest placebo effect in the world.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Wow.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And so I&#x27;m sorry if people are out there oxygen bar owners hearing me say this but I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re there anymore.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Like if you was lost a son Oxygen Bar.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s been a while, you know, but who knows maybe they&#x27;re going to become a dumb ones investing money right now as we speak listen to this podcast about the sign on the dotted line.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What wait a minute that shit&#x27;s not real and hold on.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I did see in a gift store though a bottle of oxygen. Yes, like literally your the cap off.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What like a bottle we screw the cattle aluminum take a bottle of oxygen. So those people that&#x27;s like a pet rock right there. People are assholes. Yeah.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I loved it. I would love to say they&#x27;re laughing all the way to the bank.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not sure about that and that much money but whatever money they&#x27;re making they&#x27;re stealing now. Why don&#x27;t we have this? Why is it in that generally acknowledged that carbon? Dioxide is very beneficial to life.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I think CO2 is gotten this really bad rap, you know, we talked about CO2 increasing in the atmosphere acidification of the ocean global warming is the stuff that comes off of rotting fruit, you know, but but Not looking a pulmonologist is going to know the importance of a balanced of CO2. So people in that field absolutely no it and so they&#x27;ve written they&#x27;ve said thank you for getting this out out in the open because people don&#x27;t realize it they you can go outside right now. See people jogging got to come or got to get more O2 in.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and the fact is like not only is that not doing anything for them. It&#x27;s actually making their breathing worse and making it harder for them to offload oxygen. Which is something I don&#x27;t think a lot of people realize like slower deeper breath going to be so much more efficient going to allow you to go further for longer and that&#x27;s really what you want.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So for athletes that are accustomed to having these really hard workouts a like they&#x27;re doing interval training and their sprinting and things along those lines CrossFit style workouts, and they&#x27;re used to go on.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What they should do is train themselves to slowly take in air from their nose. And how would you recommend someone doing that?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">There&#x27;s there&#x27;s some great therapist who can show you all the wonders of doing this and by practicing these breathing techniques you&#x27;re going to increase they&#x27;ve shown that you can increase red blood cells. So it&#x27;s just like altitude training and you can increase your VO2 max as well. So I&#x27;m I don&#x27;t know what sort of exercise each person is doing and so you can&#x27;t give a blanket prescription to everyone.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So someone would have to be there and be safe. What&#x27;s your heart rate?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What&#x27;s that running? What if someone does like Hill Sprints or something along those lines?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What I&#x27;ve found is nasal breathing is the way to go. You can see what Santa Richard Ross who for 10 years was the top Sprinter in the world obligatory nose breathing the whole time and to me the pictures just say everything. She&#x27;s in these races the people right next to her or look like they&#x27;re dying. She is the most Placid look on her face mouth. He&#x27;s shut kicking everyone&#x27;s but crossed a line.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So there&#x27;s tons of research there&#x27;s tons of therapists that can work with people individually because you just don&#x27;t know what how old is the person what&#x27;s the maximum heart rate where they&#x27;re going. So but we do know that nasal breathing is a more efficient way of breathing and you&#x27;re in you&#x27;re going to be able to go further and perform better.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Once that becomes a habit.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What&#x27;s fascinating to me is the sport that I On mixed martial arts. There&#x27;s a giant issue with broken noses a large percentage of the fighters have deviated septums smashed in nose is they&#x27;re clogged up and you see them breathing out of their mouth particularly when they&#x27;re tired. You see like when a fighter has their nose broken and you see blood trickling other knows one of the first signs you see as they breathe out of their mouth and that seems like well, obviously it&#x27;s terrible to get punched in the nose, right? It&#x27;s to do you have this delicate instrument and you&#x27;re using it as a Target but for someone who does Get punched in the nose for a living like what can they do? If they have this other than not do it?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I think do what you did write it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So if you&#x27;re talking about these but I&#x27;m not fighting uses if I was fighting.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I don&#x27;t know if I would get it fit. Well, I guess I probably would anyway now that I know but a lot of guys don&#x27;t because they think that just going to get broken again.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well first for those extreme cases, they&#x27;re going to need surgical intervention. If you can&#x27;t breathe through your nose, you have to find a way so now I act the guide Stanford. Me if your toilet is clogged. What are you going to do? You&#x27;re going to find a way of cleaning it out and getting that flowing again.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And when it clogs again just fix it again.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That&#x27;s that&#x27;s one way of doing it or you could make a permanent fix to it. Right? Yeah. So the so that it&#x27;s always functioning if someone&#x27;s used to getting punched in the nose every month and their their nose is getting broken again, you know, that that&#x27;s going to be really hard to nasal breathe. So so I think that either they need to stop getting punched in the nose or they have to make some other lifestyle choices, you know, if they want to continue doing that they&#x27;re going to have a hard time nasal breathing that just seems like simple physics, but it&#x27;s so crazy because it is one of the more difficult things to do athletically and athletically it seems from your work and the work that you&#x27;re citing that would be of extreme benefit to learn how to breathe through your nose.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But yet most of them can&#x27;t yeah and this is I asked Patrick McEwan the scene.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re competing you do what you can to compete. You do what you can to win which is why if you see Michael Jordan right before he dunks on someone he goes, there&#x27;s this huge breath of air that one breath of air is not going to affect his endurance or his performance, right? This is it&#x27;s about habitual nasal breathing breathing while you&#x27;re training if someone has a bloody nose or something is stuffed up there. You have to breathe somehow, right?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You&#x27;re going to breathe through your mouth, especially for boxers, you know. Yeah. It is interesting though. You look at any other animal in the A wild look at a horse running like a full-on Sprint. It&#x27;s never breathing that right ever. Look at a cheetah, like hunting hunting down some prey never breathing out of its mouth horses are when they start breathing out of their mouth.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They&#x27;re in deep trouble.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Right and dogs just do it to put cool themselves off thermoregulation. That&#x27;s yeah.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">The carbon dioxide thing is a real trip what when you&#x27;re saying that this need to take a Breath is really because your body recognizes the level of carbon. Dioxide is very high. What what happens when you become accustomed to holding your breath? Like what are their physiological changes that are taking place?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So this is what dr. Justin Feinstein is working on right now at the Laureate Institute of brain research. He has found that asthmatics and people with anxiety have this extremely low threshold for CO2 something. They need to keep breathing. They&#x27;re so paranoid that they&#x27;re not going to be able to breathe that they&#x27;ve become accustomed.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And whenever that CO2 increases they freaked out so he is found by slowly acclimating them to have more of a to be able to take more CO2 and become more comfortable with it. That&#x27;s how they can change their breathing. That&#x27;s how they can change their habits, which is exactly what those asthma techniques do right. They teach these people to breathe less and to breathe slowly to slowly acclimate themselves like someone with asthma or Panic don&#x27;t go and start. Holding your breath as long as you can that&#x27;s a bad idea. Like Let the Body adjust slowly.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, so I was a recently around someone having a panic attack and what she was saying is I can&#x27;t breathe. I&#x27;m having a hard time breathing. Obviously, she was breathing and she was talking but she was like, I can&#x27;t breathe. What would you say to a person is doing that? Just try to get them to calm down slowly breathe. Like what would you what would you say?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I would quote dr. Alicia my rat at Southern Methodist University who said the eye. Idea that people should be breathing more when they have Panic is exactly the opposite of what they should be doing. So they should be what is happening is their CO2 levels are getting so low what they need to do is breathe more slowly or hold their breath.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Can you increase your tolerance for CO2 like this? Is that like a physical thing or is it a mental thing?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Absolutely. It&#x27;s a physical thing there chemoreceptors right around here. Right? And these are the things that gauge levels of CO2. So if you think about a free diver what allows them to hold? Breath for four five six seven eight minutes. They&#x27;ve gotten this threshold of CO2. That&#x27;s very high compared to me or you or anyone else you think about someone who&#x27;s able to Summit Everest without oxygen, right? They&#x27;ve got this threshold of CO2 so so much of Fitness not not all of it. But a lot of it is dictated by by the level of CO2 that you can withstand at least with with surfing or with free diving or with alpine climbing.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So these receptors Has you train them or they get stronger as it like an endurance thing? Like, you know, your cardiovascular endurance increases your resting heart rate decreases. Like is that happen with these carbon dioxide receptors you can you can train them.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, you can acclimate them to accept a higher threshold of CO2 so that you become comfortable with it. So one of the hard things about training to free dive is those breath holds at the beginning you do these static breath holds not in water never in water. On land you see how long you can hold your breath and then miserable people, you know, maybe hold their breath maximum two minutes, but once you get used to it and go for minutes and what is what is happening when you&#x27;re getting used to it, you are allowing those those signals those those chemoreceptors are going off and sending messages to your amygdala, which is the area in the brain that dictates fear and you&#x27;re ignoring them or you just you&#x27;re accustomed to it. You&#x27;re getting accustomed to it your because you are becoming more comfortable with it because I when I heard of Frida divers diving seven minutes and holding their breath for that time and they&#x27;re doing it under water and then I try to hold my breath.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m like, what&#x27;s wrong with me? Like why I was a do I have a weak mind. Like what is it? Why am I giving in to close? What is that thing?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So what he&#x27;s doing he&#x27;s found that he&#x27;s been trying to train people in mindfulness and trying to train these people and breathing practices, but it&#x27;s really hard because he can&#x27;t be with them 24 hours a day. So what he&#x27;s now experimenting with and he&#x27;s got an NIH Grant. To do this is instead of having them practice these mini breath holds throughout the day. He&#x27;s having them come in and take a huge inhale of CO2 because his hypothesis is that that can help reset the tolerance of those chemoreceptors and and he shortcut. Yeah. It&#x27;s a little because you know, the Modern Age no one wants to actually put in the work, right? We don&#x27;t want some Swami Rama.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I think a lot of people want to be Swami Rama just no one wants the Third. Years in a cave.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and what is his results of these people taking in the burst of CO2 it is it is too soon to say he&#x27;s going to be publishing everything next year or after the absolute.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He&#x27;s in the middle of it right now. But but the premise of it makes makes perfect sense to me and this is why it describes and explains why so many of these slow breathing less practices are so effective for anxiety whether so effective for asthma as well now are there Specific coaches that work with people that have anxiety and and and use these like anxiety breath coaches. Yeah. Dr. Richard Brown and Patricia gerberg psychiatrists in New York.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I believe he&#x27;s at Columbia. They&#x27;ve developed this whole program and most of it revolve. It&#x27;s so simple that people think there&#x27;s no way this can work for me until they try it. So they bring in patients have them start with this six seconds in six seconds out. That&#x27;s it. You&#x27;d be surprised how few people actually have breed that way in the past year or five years or ten years.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They&#x27;ve found that this method of breathing was effective for 911 survivors who had this awful condition called ground glass lungs that a bunch of gunk in there. There was no therapy to get rid of it. But this breathing pattern was able to do with no other therapy could do what my breathing what happened to the people that had this ground glass stuff there their lungs were filled with garbage, right R4 and And they were constantly exhaling this Gunk right and so by breathing slowly and by helping the lungs to open up and helping with that gas exchange with CO2 and O2 they were able to help them recover so much more effectively and this is they&#x27;ve written books on this stuff. So they&#x27;re a great place to start if you want the how they&#x27;re they&#x27;re legit to their leaders in their field.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And so this breathing in and breathing out cleared their lungs or just made them.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Feel bad a significant benefit in clearing their lungs. Wow, and it makes them feel better that and that that&#x27;s the thing like there&#x27;s no side effects to doing this stuff if at the end of it, you&#x27;re like I still have asthma I still have anxiety so I don&#x27;t hurt you. The minimum is you&#x27;re going to feel better and that&#x27;s not too bad, you know, considering all the other side effects to so many other therapies.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s obviously. Yeah, it&#x27;s not a drug. What do you do?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What do I do for breathing? Yeah people think that since I spent so many years, right? Book about breathing. I&#x27;m going to be the best breather in the world. And I&#x27;m not I&#x27;ve got a long long way to go. My job. As a journalist was to go out and report on this stuff and then as objectively as I could and along the way I met people who absolutely transformed their lives so you can&#x27;t help it getting a little emotionally caught up in in this practice and in these stories and I learned a few tricks along the way I noticed what a poor breather I was I used to at night sleep with my mouth open for decades, right? I thought this was normal to go to sleep with 22 ounces of water by the bed.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Wake up every few hours dunk. Some water completely not normal at all.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So you recommend sleeping with like do you use mouth tape? Absolutely.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, you tape your mouth up every night. Yeah. I thought this sounded pretty sketchy until I heard about it from the you know, dr. Of speech-language therapy at at Stanford until I heard About it from dr. Mark / Hani. So what they&#x27;ve found they had per hen. He&#x27;s been using this stuff for decades. This is not a fat piece of duct tape people don&#x27;t go on YouTube and see what people know nine pieces of tape down. No you need a piece of tape that has a really light and easy adhesive about the size of a stamp.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You put it in the middle of your lips. The you do that even with your beard mustache.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Absolutely.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s on your it&#x27;s on your lips.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Okay, so just keep your lips closed so many People are like how dare you write about this?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m offended meanwhile quarter of the population of sleep apnea half the population is I have sleep apnea.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah. I have sleep apnea. I use a mouthpiece. I use a mouthpiece.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He presses my tongue down to keep my airway open as long as you have that airway open that is key especially at night because sleep apnea is so many chronic problems associated with that Downstream from hypertension metabolic is what do you think?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I would still have sleep apnea if I use this tape and close my mouth. There&#x27;s only One way to find out. Oh my goodness. I&#x27;m I don&#x27;t know.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not here to prescribe anything. But this tape is free. You can do it. You can gauge. I&#x27;m sure you have some sensors to monitor your sleep. If you have a pulse ox to know just go to sleep with this mouthpiece on that one. That would be a good thing to test.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It seems like a lot of work, but let me let me ask you this when you&#x27;re mine my sleep apnea occurs because I have a fat tongue and a thick neck a lot of wrestlers get this. And you know, that&#x27;s basically probably where I got it from Jujitsu, but I can breathe out of my nose. So do you think that sleep apnea would still occur if I breathe out of my nose primarily or only it can because the sleep apnea is caused by your tongue falling back. So my tongue could fall back against that hole.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Anyway, it&#x27;s less apt to with nasal breathing because nasal breathing is going to tone your Airways more and and I know from the Stanford experiment that I went from opening my mouth up the whole time. Okay. So 10 Days, I could not breathe through my nose right within two days. I was snoring had not been snoring within about four days of a snoring half the night. I got sleep apnea the other subject in the study had the exact same thing happened to him even worse than me the day we took that stuff out and we taped our mouths and were nasal breathing snoring went away.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Sleep apnea went away. My blood pressure dropped about 10 to 15 points. Hmm. So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s something that people can test it. Is as well, you can test the quality of your sleep. It&#x27;s not asking too much. And once I learned that this did not require a fat piece of tape that the point wasn&#x27;t to hermetically seal your mouth shut which sounds a little scary to a lot of people and it should be it&#x27;s just a train the jaw shut at 9 so you don&#x27;t go I saw there&#x27;s a device not a device like a neoprene strap.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It goes under your chin and wraps around your head and keeps your jaw. Shut is that dumb as all there&#x27;s all kinds of stuff but it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s a I haven&#x27;t tried it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I don&#x27;t know I think you know, maybe some people get some benefit from it and that&#x27;s great. I do know that tape is almost free and I&#x27;ve seen some incredible results myself subjectively, but they&#x27;re also doing some studies and if you look at burhan, he&#x27;s work that he&#x27;s done for the past few decades. I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a quick and easy fix that can work for a lot of in this is something that you use every night. I use it every night when I don&#x27;t guess what happens.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah. I&#x27;m out. Got something start snoring. Yeah, and I wish that I didn&#x27;t have to I would figure at this time that it would become habit, but I&#x27;m not one of those people who have that really strong jaw that stays shut its my mouth just just opens and the difference in quality of sleep from doing this has been has been profound.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m glad you brought that up because I was something else I wanted to talk to you about what you were talking about the changes in human diet and eating soft foods and how it affects the way the jaw develops and the the size of the jaw. And that there&#x27;s a way to improve that which I found fascinating.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and this was something when you set out to write a book about breathing. The last thing you think you&#x27;re going to be doing is handing, you know around a bunch of ancient skulls and looking at teeth, but that&#x27;s where this journey led me I had heard from some biological Anthropologist that our faces have changed and that our mouths have gotten too small and that was one of the reasons so many of us were breathing so poorly and so I thought well this sounds interesting. Eating these people are legit. I want to check it out.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And if you take an ancient skull anything older than 500 years old 5,000 years old 50 thousand years old. You&#x27;re going to see by and large about 99% chance. These skills are going to have perfectly straight teeth. They never had their wisdom teeth removed. They never had braces any orthodonture anything they had straight teeth because they had these very wide and large mouths and these powerful jaws.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">If you start getting into the modern era of industrialized food, Mouse start shrinking so why do we have crooked teeth not from genetics. It&#x27;s because our mouths have grown so small that the teeth have nowhere to go so they grow crooked and what else happens when you have a mouth that&#x27;s too small for its teeth.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You have a smaller Airway. So this is one of the reasons why so many people have snoring sleep apnea and other respiratory problems this sounded so bizarre because it&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;d ever learned in school. But all anyone needs to do is look, Some ancient skulls if you&#x27;re online and check out their teeth and check out how they have these huge Jaws these big flat wide faces powerful faces and they all had this and then you go into the wild 5400 different mammals and check out and see how many have crooked teeth.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">The answer is zero. So some some Bulldogs do because they&#x27;ve been bred to have this flat face just like humans. Yeah, but but animals in the wild have straight teeth and and We did too as a species. We have straight teeth, but but because of industrialization specifically because of food our mouths of grown too small, you would never believe that if someone told me that other than reading your book and kind of understanding where your where you coming from.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I would think this is nonsense. It&#x27;s genetics. Yeah, like what why people have small hands or people have big feet or whatever.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, it&#x27;s become a heritable trait. So so what&#x27;s happened now is they&#x27;ve Found the researchers who have done this rubber core Cheney worked on the stuff for 30 years has 250 scientific papers on it. They found within the first generation of switching to industrialize Foods about 50% of the population is going to have malocclusion, which means a crooked jaw crooked teeth after that about sixty to seventy percent Next Generation after that about 80% after that look around that&#x27;s us now about 90% Jesus. So if know I was gonna bum you out.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Good morning.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So they&#x27;re dr. Kevin Boyd is now doing studies where he&#x27;s looking at fetuses in the womb and is seen their mouth size is too small and they have this backward slant to their faces. Just like I have just like so many people in the population have if you were to measure a skull and you were to draw one line from its ear to its nose and another line perpendicular to that almost every single ancient skull would be above that line. Very powerful jaw now, 90% of modern skulls are below it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So they are behind it. So in this is happening now, it is becoming a heritable trait. So kids are messed up to begin with which is why so many kids are have sleep apnea and snoring now, which is so injurious to their to their health and this came about because they weren&#x27;t chewing tougher food.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They didn&#x27;t need the muscles and what can be done to sort of reverse that or mitigate that in adulthood it&#x27;s harder in for kids.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s much easier because their muscles are and their bones are much more malleable, but that&#x27;s exactly what they found is. Once you introduce we used to chew for about 4 hours a day. Okay, that that&#x27;s just how it was from the dawn of time to to about 500 years ago. But as wheat started getting processed in a white flower as rice became we started taking the German the brand way from Rice. It&#x27;s just the Polish seed as Things become.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">To get canned and bottled if you think about even what&#x27;s considered healthy food right now smoothies avocado oatmeal. All this stuff is so much power bars, right? So in adulthood there you can make some changes and that&#x27;s what I tried to do in my own face as a experiment for kids. What they&#x27;re finding is these problems need to be diagnosed very early and they need to be treated and what they do is they widen the mouth both to the way that they were supposed to be 500 years ago. So we&#x27;re changing our bodies by force of will to the way that the nature had made them before we messed them up.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What was there was a doctor that you were talking about that develop some sort of a retainer that actually change the volume of your jaw as an adult and change the volume of your mouth.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That&#x27;s right. So I had crooked teeth growing up. I had braces I had extractions I had gear and me and everyone I knew had the same thing. It was never if We&#x27;re going to get it. It&#x27;s just when are you going to get your braces? Right? So the point of all this things was to straighten teeth, but they&#x27;re not looking at Airway Health, right? So so what happens just as a principle, you&#x27;ve got a mouth that&#x27;s too small for its face that teeth are growing and crooked you extract teeth from that get some headgear and go.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Hmm, you&#x27;re creating at least there&#x27;s a significant argument by many people in the field that say you&#x27;re making a small mouth smaller and and one leader in the field. Dr. Michael gelles is at 50% of people who have Orthodontics are going to have more breathing problems because of it Orthodontics meaning braces as well braces are craning in so it&#x27;s combination of braces and especially headgear and and some of that stuff is being phased out braces are still you&#x27;re forcing teeth into a smaller space, too.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Make them to make them straight. So there is this the very first Orthodontics weren&#x27;t craning teeth in to make them straight. They would expand the mouth because even back then hundred twenty years ago. They knew our mouths were growing too small. They knew that so the first device is I thought this was fascinating they were using this for kids who have cleft palates had it all of these other problems where they were having problem chewing and and breathing so they would expand their mouths with this device that went to the roof of your mouth.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Mouth and it had a little dowel screw and you slowly opened it up to expand the mouth. What does it feel like it doesn&#x27;t feel great. So this is where I think a lot of Orthodontics is heading because it allows you to have straighter teeth, but it also opens your Airway.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But how long do you keep it in your EQ in your mouth like braces all day long.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And now the one that I use was called a homeo block and this guy had been using it for 30 years and I used it at night. So you put it on the palate upper palate and you slow you have this little screw thing this little handle that every couple weeks. You open it a little more too slowly.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">There. It is. Jamie&#x27;s got a picture of it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">All right.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So if you think that you used one of those yeah, I did not none none as gnarly as that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">This looks intense, but if you fill your head right now you feel these sutures right these cracks in your head. You have one of those on your upper palate. And so that can open. Okay, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s made to do it can open and you can widen your mouth and adulthood and I showed this through cat-scans and by that you can open your Airway and you can breathe better.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And how long did you wear it for?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I wore for one year one year two to the week. I took the other cat scan and you gained how much volume in your mouth I gained about five pennies worth of bone in my face, which is crazy five.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So stack them up. Yeah five pennies.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, so it&#x27;s a lot of bone man. So we&#x27;ve been we&#x27;ve been told that we can&#x27;t grow bone past 30 right? It&#x27;s just entropy. We&#x27;re only going to be losing we can we can stop it from from disappearing we can do some things to help prevent that loss but we can&#x27;t build it but we can we can build it in the center of our face and the maxilla so you can really change the structure of your face from doing you could widen your face you can Add more bone you can model more bone inside of your face. You look better while you&#x27;re doing that. You think you can&#x27;t you tell you good looking man, but I mean, did you think you look better?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I will not say better. I won&#x27;t use those naked. Jesus know it worse worse. People be be forewarned. Don&#x27;t build bone in your mouth. I did notice after after about six weeks of wearing this thing. People were like to what happened.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What are you doing?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They can see a shift absolutely and it&#x27;s and it&#x27;s very apparent. There&#x27;s you can see a bunch of case studies on this and you can see it for yourself. And the neat thing is it&#x27;s not subjective. It&#x27;s not well, I think I look different right there&#x27;s cat-scans and there&#x27;s metrics to it. So so and it also opened my Airways it allowed me to expand. I don&#x27;t know how much is probably maybe 15% 20% but it was a lot mostly the toning of the airway.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Why did you stop using it after a year?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m still using it you are so I for the book for the research I said I&#x27;m going to do this for one. And I&#x27;m going to wear it every night. I&#x27;m really going to be dedicated. Even after having a few few beers was like the last thing I want to do is put this thing in my mouth and go to sleep, but I did it because I was curious because I had heard these stories at seen the case studies.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;d see the data but I wanted to see what would happen in my in my own body and I tell you on a subjective level I breathe more easily now than I can ever remember breathing. I haven&#x27;t had pneumonia bronchitis any of those problems, but there&#x27;s a bunch of factors though.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So to right there&#x27;s the nose breathing. There&#x27;s the breath work. So it&#x27;s a combination of all these things.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, but nose breathing wouldn&#x27;t help you build more bone writer fit course. So a lot of that was due to the this device not only spread open that suture in the upper palate but also stimulated chewing stress. So on one side there was this little bump. So every time you closed your mouth you got some chewing stress which would stimulate stem cells which would go into those sutures and build more bone.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Differences when when you clench your jaws right now, just like, you know, you&#x27;re boxing your intent you&#x27;re clenching your jaws that does not stimulate that that good beneficial chewing stress. Okay, because our bodies identify that as sympathetic stress of cortisol levels go up, right? That means growth isn&#x27;t going to happen.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But if you think about eating a big piece of steak or a carrot, you&#x27;re not chewing on both sides of your molars you&#x27;re chewing on one side or the other so when you stimulate Late the stress on one side of the other your if you next time you&#x27;re chewing on something think yeah, I think about well aware that that&#x27;s why you salivate and and you become more relaxed and that&#x27;s when that growth can happen.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So chewing on one side or the other stimulate stem cells that don&#x27;t get stimulated if you just like biting down on a mouthpiece because of cortisol and osteoclast now, how often do you have this thing in your mouth now?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I took a break after year. See what life was like on the other side. I wasn&#x27;t so nice. It&#x27;s great. But but I got curious. I talked to the guy who gave me this device. Dr. Ted Bell for and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s used this thing for 30 years and his case studies are pretty fascinating and I talked to him. He&#x27;s like, oh we should do another CAT scan see what happened didn&#x27;t quite admit to him that I had stopped using it. So I felt a little guilty and now for the past about month and a half I&#x27;ve been back on The back on the train to see what happens. So we&#x27;re going to take another one just for kicks.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m not going to write about the books already done. But I just I&#x27;m curious to see what will happen. If you keep wearing this if you can really keep improve you the Swami Rama of Orthodontics if you get hold that bad boy in your mouth for a few years.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I mean, I&#x27;d be really fascinating if you change your face and all sudden you have like this big Clark Kent Superman type. Jaw.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Can you let me shack up here for a couple years and then I&#x27;m just going to focus on this all day.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Just stay in the song. To go do what you got to do. So, where would one get one of these things?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">There&#x27;s many different devices. So the one I use was the homeo blocked Ed belfour can set you up with that. Would you have to go to a doctor to get measured as yeah, you have to go to a dentist or an orthodontist would set you up with this but but there&#x27;s many different ones that do the same thing. What a lot of people do instead of having this thing in your mouth for a year.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They go in and the sounds gnarly, I&#x27;ve apparently it&#x27;s not as gnarly as it sounds but that going and drill in the same. Yeah and open it up that way but people who have done this and they&#x27;re using this especially for kids and they&#x27;re using this for teenagers repeatedly their allergies go away. They can breathe better. They look totally different because they&#x27;re expanding because growth is centered around this right here.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So, where are they drilling in like the upper palate their drill into the upper palate and they put a device in there? Yep, so it&#x27;s permanent so you can&#x27;t get it out and Until they take it out, but it&#x27;s much quicker this this expansion happens quickly over the course of a couple of months. Oh, so you&#x27;ve been in your mouth for a couple months.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah and and your teeth start widening out, you know, and then then they fix it. So Marianna Evans is an expert at this. Dr. William hang who&#x27;s right around here. He&#x27;s been doing this for 30 years very respected and he knows the stuff better than anyone. Hmm. So yeah, but what do they do? your lower jaw Nothing, it&#x27;s all about this paper palette and your lower jaw while they could use that could use braces or something. But but it&#x27;s all about the upper palate and there are some devices you&#x27;d have to ask hang. They&#x27;ve got all the gizmos to do that. The reason we&#x27;re I thought this was so interesting that this was how orthodontist this is how teeth were straight and write a hundred years ago. And then by the 40s, they found a way of making Dentistry more of a production line.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Where one size fits all we&#x27;re going to yank teeth braces on dun dun dun but this expansion takes a lot of expertise and a lot of focus, but what I&#x27;m seeing now within that industry, there&#x27;s this huge moment of change where they&#x27;ve realized so many people have realized that some of these processes might have caused breathing problems. And so they&#x27;re reassessing how they&#x27;ve been doing things and you know one orthodontist told me he&#x27;s like, we&#x27;re going to look back in 10 years and horrified by what we&#x27;ve done Tony.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But it&#x27;s it&#x27;s so interesting to me that breathing and breath work and knowing how to breathe properly is it&#x27;s not common knowledge, but it&#x27;s so critical to health and it&#x27;s free. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re not talking about something that requires devices or or like a cabbage along learning curve for just just some of these benefits so so many of them and especially the most simple ones right anyone can breathe in Six seconds in six seconds out.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">If you want to really go up to the next stage and figure out what breathing can really do for you on a bigger and more powerful level you can do to Mo you can do with hey, if you can do holotropic you can do crea&#x27;s you can do pranayamas. They&#x27;re all doing the same thing and holotropic.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;ve I haven&#x27;t done it but it makes you trip right?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s an interesting experience. What was it like for you? You know, I know a lot of people have found profound benefits from this. They used it in a hospital 11,000 people were put through this thing and they showed it was more effective than any other therapy me personally that the science is much more thin and holotropic breathwork and what I had been told by the instructors kind of threw me off or they&#x27;re like they sit you in a room and they blast music and for three hours you breathe as hard as you can and they told me that you&#x27;re going to be able to enter into the space because so much oxygen. Gin is getting into your body.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">The opposite is happening. You were inhibiting blood flow to your brain. And so your brain is processing that as a threat and sometimes you inhibit so much blood flow that perhaps your brain is interpreting this as though you are dying which is why so many people have this reaction where they said, I am reborn after holotropic and that&#x27;s awesome. I don&#x27;t want to take that away from anyone. But but what I&#x27;ve seen is that The the site there is not there&#x27;s been a ton of subjective anecdotal studies not a ton of few of them, but the actual science behind it. No one&#x27;s gone into an fmri and looked at what&#x27;s really happening and that&#x27;s something I really want to do and hopefully I&#x27;m going to be doing in the next next few months just for curiosity that makes sense.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">If people are having psychedelic experiences because many psychedelic experiences are tied to near-death experiences. A lot of people that have near-death experiences. They report these Moments that mimic what a lot of people have experience on psychedelics. So what they&#x27;re doing through this holotropic breathing they&#x27;re harming themselves, right or do we not know not not that I know of the the doctor who put 11,000 people and said that nobody had any problems there were no side effects.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So I&#x27;ve heard that some people can can freak out. I heard that there&#x27;s possible bowel issues involved. Oh and some some real meltdowns in the class that I took I was not sure how much was psychosomatic and how much was actually because of the breathing. I had a pretty strange experience where a guy turned into a wolf for a while. Whoa.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well when real wolf went humping around the room. Oh so a guy no number to you if I wish if it were a real wolf has been incredible, but he thought he was a wolf. He inhabited the body.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Maybe he was just an asshole that&#x27;s possible too and just like Act it out, or maybe he really became a wolf.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">We will never know which is why this stuff should be studied. You know, there&#x27;s a lot of talk that breathing this way will trigger endogenous DMT and that&#x27;s the reason people trip out so hard I tried to do a study in which I would Breathe this way and they would take blood before and after but the scientists that I was talking to said it would be such a small amount. They wouldn&#x27;t be able to detect it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So there&#x27;s a lot of gray area which to me is not a bad thing. It&#x27;s great. They&#x27;re still missed. Therese to breath there&#x27;s Mysteries through the human body, right and if people are finding great benefit from this and there&#x27;s no side effect. And then that&#x27;s great. I just found it was a little little thinner than the other techniques like Wim Hof method or like Priya now, I this guy that had this experience and he turned into well.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Did you talk to him before awesome guy super solid normal.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He was a lawyer working in San Francisco and left and went to live off. Grid in a cabin in Mendocino, which is completely legit and admirable and he was a he was a groovy dude and afterwards really warm welcoming guy. So I don&#x27;t want to take away any process that he went through. He said it was very cleansing for himself. And I think that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s great. You&#x27;re a very nice guy.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I wish I was there. I&#x27;d have to rip to rip on it, right? Yeah. I understand. I understand. Yeah. I&#x27;m just saying you&#x27;re very nice guy with your Glamour, I&#x27;d like to talk to him.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You know where we can find him. He&#x27;s out in the tundra right now. You gotta go hunt him down. Does he know I have no idea maybe right.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Maybe he&#x27;s got a like a caribou in his mouth could be so this guy ran around. Do you have clothes on we do this?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah. Yeah, he was he was scratching his crotch a little bit and growling and growl and it got it got interesting. Yeah, everyone saw it and again, you know, he was going through this process. That was cool. But the whole time I was Watching him breathing and he wasn&#x27;t really breathing any differently than me because what you do is you have half the class or the sitter&#x27;s for the people who are breathing and you watch over these people in case they have problems. So I was a sitter during this process. I was not breathing and was looking as respiration really didn&#x27;t look any different. So I&#x27;m wondering how much of this is the set and setting of this you&#x27;re in Mendocino.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You&#x27;re at a hot springs. There&#x27;s really loud music fake Lutz music is us, you know. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s something I wish they could have worked on a little bit about Allah wish but it was a lot of like fake keyboard Lutz and symbol the fake tinny cymbal crashes the the makam hall.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">That&#x27;s the kind of music that plan. Yeah, but that would seem like, you know when you talk about set and setting that would seem to be like a terrible set and setting.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well a lot of people enjoyed that music and good good good for them. It would be interesting. Staying to mix it up with with three hours of Death Metal right and just see where that would take Zeppelin.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So I&#x27;m good.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I planned that that would be fine.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, I just yeah. Um, so when you did it, so you were a sitter but then you also did it right and when you did it, what did you experience?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, it definitely affects you because you&#x27;re breathing in a certain way. It&#x27;s going to affect your physiology. So yeah, I got really cold. I got really hot. Got really Spacey. I felt like I was kind of dreaming for a while three. Hours is a long time to breathe as hard as you possibly can but the shifts in temperature and in circulation because the body is trying to compensate right?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So the more your breathing your pH is going to be, you know going down so you&#x27;re becoming more alkaline. So so your body doesn&#x27;t like that. It really wants the pH because all the cellular functions happen at a certain pH some point for so it was to me it was fascinating to feel my body fighting against this and constantly To balance itself throughout the whole thing, but it&#x27;s definitely Spacey. There&#x27;s no doubt about a Spacey.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">What do you want?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You are extremely lightheaded you feel very high starting to Ben Greenfield about it. And he said it was the most profound spiritual experience. He&#x27;s ever had just by breathing and a lot of people say the same thing. I you know, those subjective experiences are cool, but I think it would be a lot more interesting to find out what happens to everybody. Not just one person. When they do this and to look at the brain and to look at the body and really Analyze That to to see if there&#x27;s some physiological reaction. We know what&#x27;s happening with blood flow to the brain. We know what happens to the brain when it&#x27;s deny blood flow to the blood flow to certain areas.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But how does that affect us psychologically afterward? How does that affect us? Physically? I think these are good questions and be interesting to find out how long does it take you to feel like you recovered from that experience pretty pretty quickly. I went outside. Afterwards and drank a beer in my car and just sort of re-centered.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But but it was mostly just the feeling of extreme lightheadedness dreaminess and then everything just sort of boils back down and you&#x27;re back in Mendocino at the hot tubs, you know.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Mmm and when when they sell you on this like what would they have a class for holotropic breathing? What are they? What are they saying? It&#x27;s going to do.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, they can&#x27;t claim any medical benefits, right? Because the he would come after them, but they say it is a spiritual journey and for many people it is and and I think that&#x27;s a wonderful thing that they&#x27;re getting benefit from this and they use this this fuzzy language like that because they can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s going to help with your asthma they can write but but what&#x27;s interesting is there are other methods like Crea sudarshan kriya 60 independent studies and is so similar to holotropic the differences.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You don&#x27;t breathe super hard for three hours you breathe extremely intensely. Five minutes then slow it down.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">But let me ask you about holotropic breathing first before creature. So holotropic breathing. What is the actual technique? Like? How does it how do you do it you breathe is hard and as fast as you are a so, you&#x27;re not taking big deep breaths.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Whatever you want to do.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Whatever you want to do is so you don&#x27;t do that you breathing through the nose through the mouth whatever you want to do.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">They say through the mouth is going to allow you to get more air. In a real this was yeah because I didn&#x27;t ya larger volume. Yeah for sure and this was created in the 70s by stanislav. Grof who is a psychiatrist who was one of the first test subjects of LSD and he started using LSD at Johns Hopkins and in other universities and found it had this profound effect for people with schizophrenia and other serious problems it got banned in what 68 and so he wanted to find a way to allow people to have these Experiences without the drug and so he developed the specifically to mimic the effects of LSD.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s written 12 books on this stuff some of the science mostly the psychology of what&#x27;s happening with it. I wish that there was some more hard science to it. There&#x27;s not yet. But hopefully that&#x27;s forthcoming and that number three hours is a consistent. They&#x27;ve been it&#x27;s interesting when I did this and this was several years ago. It was three hours so you had to go Oh three hours now they&#x27;re doing I guess that was too hard for a lot of people there doing these our sessions which is which is news to me.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Again. Everybody wants be Swami Rama. Nobody wants to live in a cave for 30 years. Three hours is the marrow man. I think you too much time, bro.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You got it. I thought but if you&#x27;re gonna go into that zone, I think you want the the the full pie not not just the piece. Yeah, I would imagine but I guess it&#x27;s pretty hard for people to do that for that long.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;ve had some friends have done the whole Tropic breathing. One of the reason why I ask you this and these friends are pretty hardcore psychedelic experimenters and they found it very profound. They said that they could achieve states that are very similar to psychedelic experiences.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You hear that all the time and you didn&#x27;t find that I found a very lightly I did not go into the the spectral universe and you&#x27;ve done that before.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Have you had psychedelic experiences before I?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I have I went to college but but I did not want to call them too deep all these disclaimers my mom&#x27;s my mom.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Oh, I understand. Okay, you can wink. Okay, I got it now Korea. What is the difference in Crete?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I so so kriya is a breathing technique that is very similar to holotropic breathwork. But the difference is it&#x27;s much more controlled. So you&#x27;re having these. First of heavy breathing but then you have these bursts of very slow breathing and this was developed in the 80s and they started opening up to studies and there&#x27;s a just as I mentioned. There&#x27;s been 60 independent studies showing how effective this stuff is for any that have been done at Harvard that have been done it legitimate institutions search showing how effective for some autoimmune diseases for anxiety for depression for other issues. And what I think is is interesting is so you&#x27;ve got Wim Hof&#x27;s breathing which is very effective for some autoimmune issues for some asthma for anxiety. You&#x27;ve got kriya which is doing the same thing. So what I found on the book is people have been coming at this stuff from different directions, but they&#x27;re coming to the same conclusions about these breathing methods and these very hard and heavy breathing methods people think why do I want to stress myself out? So I&#x27;m stressed out enough with work with my kids. Whatever.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">When I breathe I want to chill out but that&#x27;s exactly what these very powerful breathing methods do is they focus that stress into one 20 minute time period so that the rest of the time you can actually go to sleep so you can actually be rested and relaxed and and that&#x27;s what what Wim Hof&#x27;s version of tummo does and that&#x27;s what crio does it all also it stimulates the sympathetic stress. You&#x27;re completely really going for it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">You turn it on.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Really so you can turn it off so you what is the Rhythm in terms of like like how hard breathing versus slow breathing what is days in Korea?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It is a lot of slow breathing at the beginning and then there&#x27;s a medium breathing phase when you say slow breathing like how much time how much time are the breaths? I have not counted. I&#x27;ve been following an instructor, but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s usually thinking of because This this guy Ravi Shankar is the one who dictates this thing. So it&#x27;s only he&#x27;s the only guy who doesn&#x27;t and it comes so he sends out these cassette tapes was so quaint or CDs people play these so the slower ones are about so to three seconds. Yeah about that and then after that or medium, so and then you go for it is as hard and as fast, fast as you can And did is there any literature and how they arrived at that specific Rhythm he had been studying. He&#x27;s another another guy who was spent his lifetime in meditation and in yoga and went on his spiritual enlightenment Quest and came out of it with this is a breathing technique that I want to help share with people all of that sounds really fuzzy right until you start studying it until you start doing studies to see how people have benefited. Dad from this and that&#x27;s what I think so so important no matter how granola it sounds if you can measure it you can study it if you can study it you can find whether or not it works and it certainly is worked for so many people and these studies like what have they shown in terms of the benefits?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Like what was the duration that the people were doing it for? Mhm.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So even after a few weeks of doing this this isn&#x27;t the only so there&#x27;s four different tangents of this breathing and they say that you can only really learn it in one. Our schools. So there&#x27;s this very soft breathing where you put your hands like this then you put your hands like this underneath your armpits and you put your hands like this and you breathe into account of for why do they would what is the purpose of the I think it&#x27;s the open up? I think it&#x27;s open up the lungs.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah to create flexibility. Hmm. So it starts with that. There&#x27;s the obligatory. Ohms which everyone&#x27;s doing nowadays. And and then there&#x27;s that really intense that cleansing breath at the end which to me is the by far the most potent.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So there&#x27;s almost like a warm-up. Yeah for sure you&#x27;re getting the and what&#x27;s the duration of their their practice like the the slower breathing where you have your hands on your hips will probably go on for about again.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I haven&#x27;t time this because I&#x27;ve been in a class but probably seven minutes seven or eight minutes. Ohms you do 3, ohms with a couple minutes, but that long cleansing breath is about 40 minutes long.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So the whole thing you&#x27;re done our Yeah. Hmm, and how many times have you done this? I&#x27;ve probably done it hundreds of times.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Really?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, and do you get the same sort of trippy feeling that you got with holotropic breathing the the body is different every day.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So it depends where your mind is depends on where your body is, but every single time I feel very different at the end. I feel much better clear-headed. I&#x27;m able to sleep a lot better. So, you know, I&#x27;ve done this in the class dozens and dozens of times and they had a YouTube video. Of this practice that I doubt now it now it&#x27;s offline.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So I downloaded that and I&#x27;m able to follow along with that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So what are you doing? Currently? We kind of barely touched on it. But what do you what is your daily routine?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Do you have a daily routine my daily routine for last couple of months has been awful because I&#x27;ve just been on book tour for two a book tour and and when you notice something when you talk for four or five hours a day, what am I doing now breathing through my mouth over and over. I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons it&#x27;s exhausting mentally exhausting physically exhausting. But one thing I try to do is I set up a little time.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Is a zillion different apps you can do to focus on those six seconds in six seconds out breaths because I notice the first thing that I do in the morning I sit down at my computer look at you know, 40 different emails. I stopped breathing and I know this because I put on a pulse ox and watch my oh to just go straight down and this is so they say that up to 80% of office workers have this. It&#x27;s called email apnea and they&#x27;ve studied it some researchers at the end up Mia.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah if you think about it next time We sit down at a computer. You&#x27;ve got a Twitter on you&#x27;ve got your phone open. You just lose focus on your body. You lose focus on your posture. So you&#x27;re saying like this which makes it really hard to take a deep breath. And then you lose focus on your how healthily your breathing and so I&#x27;ve found that if I focus on that right from the get-go I can sort of set myself up for some good habits.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I also try to incorporate when I&#x27;m when I&#x27;m working out. I always nasal breathe and I try to Breathe breathe less and increase my tolerance for CO2. But I do when Hoffs to mow. I do Crea do some pranayamas try to do those a few times a week in total and they&#x27;re offered for free. There&#x27;s there&#x27;s a free one you can do on Monday nights at 9:00. This guy isn&#x27;t selling anything.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">He was a type 1 diabetic had anxiety had high blood pressure had depression and he was able to bait so many of the symptoms of those things.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">How do you access this free breathing?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Being Chuck McGee is the one who does it&#x27;s in the back of my book the URL. You can look up his name. Also online Chuck McGee Wim Hof instructor and it&#x27;s and what&#x27;s so cool. You have no idea. This guy&#x27;s even a breathing that he doesn&#x27;t advertise anything. He does this because breathing has fundamentally changed his life in a measured way.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So he no longer is on blood pressure medicine. He&#x27;s taking 80% less insulin. His anxiety is a beta it&#x27;s a depression is debated and these are things that have been For the Wim Hof guys, there&#x27;s thousands of these people reporting this drops and CRP of 40-fold within two weeks of doing this. So it&#x27;s fascinating stuff.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So he leads a live stream. Is that what it is? Yeah, and it&#x27;s nightly know.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">It&#x27;s 11:00 Monday night 9 p.m. Et/pt but what&#x27;s cool is he will then send you a recording of this so you can practice it whenever you want an audio recording that you get on your phone or is it a physical? No, no, he&#x27;ll send. You can get on your phone download it and listen to it whenever you want, which is what I&#x27;ve done. I have about four of his different sessions here. So whenever I was traveling when people were doing that, especially if I was traveling spending a lot of times in hotels, I would do this to really reset myself and help go to sleep when you said his name is Chuck McGee is a yeah, that&#x27;s it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">And so&#x27;s like Chuck McGee.com or something like that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">His website is something Viking breath works. Oh one of those it&#x27;s a Our DRL. Yes my Viking have to ask him because they did a lot of crazy shit, right?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah, who they were free divers. Yeah, they were free divers. So there was a lot of like weird chanting and stuff lysed Viking ice liking tie into the Wim Hof cold expired.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Okay, and he&#x27;s dealing a lot not just with people who are healthy. You want to go up that next rung of human potential but with people of chronic pain who have chronic diseases and that&#x27;s an area. I think that we&#x27;re just starting to learn about how effective this stuff is and and how we can better treat these people instead of giving them tranquilizers help to treat the core problem do that through breathing properly.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Well, listen, man, I really enjoyed your book and I really enjoyed talking to you. I think the information is so valuable. It&#x27;s so interesting and and I know from my own personal experience that there&#x27;s a great benefit to really learning how to breathe correctly and concentrating on. Breathing and I&#x27;m going to start working out now with through my nose. I&#x27;m going to try that now do my kickboxing like clench my mouth down just completely breathe through my nose and I&#x27;ll let you know.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">So the book it&#x27;s called breath. You can basically get it everywhere. And again, I got the audio recording and I really enjoyed it. What do you have a Instagram Facebook All That Jazz?</p><p class="css-19iowwu">Yeah my website. Mr. James Nestor. I knew that these claims are going. To sound impossible to people so there&#x27;s more than 500 scientific references there with x-rays with videos with pictures also on Instagram trying to get better at the social media thing. So, it&#x27;s mr. James Nestor at on Instagram Twitter Facebook all that.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I always appreciate when a journalist or an author is terrible at Instagram because it makes me think they&#x27;re much more authentic when people are really good at I get very suspicious. So well, I don&#x27;t have to scare you off on that I suck at it.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I&#x27;m trying to get better good for Thank you for everything man.</p><p class="css-19iowwu">I really appreciate it.
